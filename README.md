Step-by-Step Guide to Create the Project
Initialize React Project:

Open a terminal and create a new React project:
bash
Copy code
npx create-react-app resume-builder
cd resume-builder
Create Resume Sections:

Inside the src/components/ folder, create different components like PersonalInfo.js, Skills.js, Experience.js, and Education.js.
Create the Main App:

In App.js, import and render these components. Use state to hold user input and dynamically display it on a preview section.
Styling:

Use CSS (create a styles.css) to make the form and resume preview visually appealing.
Testing:

Run the application using npm start and make sure everything works as expected.
Build and Deploy:

Once development is done, create a production build using npm run build and deploy it to services like Netlify or GitHub Pages.
